  abstract = {Global monitoring of land surface properties has primarily relied on the AVHRR red and near-infrared channels through use of the NDVI. The AVHRR Channel 3, centered at 3.75 \ensuremath{{\mu}}m, has been shown to be sensitive to vegetation on a local scale. A method to separate the reflected and emitted components in this channel has been developed. The 3.75-\ensuremath{{\mu}}m reflectivity is computed by subtracting the thermal contribution from the total signal and dividing the remaining signal component by atmospheric transmission and solar irradiance. The thermal contribution is estimated by using thermal infrared Channels 4 and 5 as well as NDVI to estimate infrared surface emissivities. The atmospheric transmission is computed with MODTRAN2 and uses integrated water vapor derived from the Split Window Technique. The formula derived are validated over ocean using sun glint observations and land using the FIFE-87 data set. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the procedure we adopted, quantitative use of the derived reflectance at 3.75 \ensuremath{{\mu}}m appears possible.},

  abstract = {The following paper presents a method to retrieve surface reflectance, emissivity and temperature in the middle infrared (3{\textendash}5 \ensuremath{{\mu}}m) and thermal infrared (8{\textendash}12 \ensuremath{{\mu}}m). It is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired over Southern Africa during the August to October 2000 period. This method relies first on atmospheric correction of the middle-thermal infrared radiances which uses National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) humidity, pressure and temperature profiles and second on constructing and using a database of night emissivities ratio (Temperature Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity, TISIE). The middle infrared reflectances (3{\textendash}5 \ensuremath{{\mu}}m) are then derived from day-time measurements and mean TISIE values. By hemispheric integration (over a 16-day period), they lead to middle infrared directional emissivity which, combined with TISIE again, leads to thermal infrared emissivity and surface temperature. The reflectance accuracies are assessed by looking at targets of known reflectance (water and sun-glint). The emissivities in the thermal infrared are assessed by checking the spectral invariance of the derived surface temperature in the 3{\textendash}5- and 8{\textendash}12-\ensuremath{{\mu}}m region. Other consistency checks are performed leading to the conclusion that the reflectance, emissivity and surface temperature are derived within \ensuremath{{\pm}}0.015, \ensuremath{{\pm}}0.01 and \ensuremath{{\pm}}1 K, respectively. Finally, a direct application of the MODIS middle infrared surface reflectances to the fire detection problem is developed and the results compared to the Landsat 7 high spatial resolution data.},

  abstract = {Abstract 
MODIS land surface reflectance product (MOD09) is one of the most popular data sources for characterizing land surface environments. Because those cloudy observations should be excluded from further analysis, the reliable cloud screening is important for downstream applications. In this paper, an approach is proposed to generate cloud masks from time series of MOD09 products. It is found that an inflexion point exists between the clear-sky and cloudy observations if time series of reflectances assembled from the same location are sorted. The maximum surface reflectance can be composited from these inflexions and those observations with reflectance values larger than the inflexion are identified as cloudy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to composite the maximum snow-free surface reflectance. And a new method is proposed to objectively compare cloud detection results derived from different approaches. Comparisons show that this inflexion-based cloud detection algorithm performs generally better than the cloud masks accompanying with the MOD09 products. The new cloud masks are valuable for those applications relying on the MOD09 products as input and for analysis of the uncertainty of the MODIS cloud mask products.},

  abstract = {Cloud cover strongly affects the evapotranspiration, especially in the tropics and subtropics. This poster describes a nearglobal 250m pixel resolution daytime cloud climatology developed using 10 years of MODIS imagery from two sunsynchronous polar-orbiting NASA satellites. Our simple thresholding procedure to extract cloudiness from individual visible 
images and average them to produce monthly, seasonal and multiannual means has some limitations but is reliable over 
most of the tropics and subtropics. Our thresholding procedure is not as reliable where snow cover is frequent. The most 
important results from our work are that mean daytime cloudiness is strongly controlled by small topographic features 
throughout the moist tropics and that the underlying vegetation in many regions closely mirrors the mean cloudiness 
patterns. Thus, these cloud climatologies should be useful for not only improving the mapping of high-rainfall cloud forest 
distributions, but may be even more important in low-rainfall regimes, such as along the coasts of Peru, Chile, and Baja 
California, and parts of southern Arabia and eastern Africa. Many taller oceanic islands also show prominent stratocumuluscontrolled moist environments (e.g. the Galapagos, Cape Verde, and Canary Islands and some others regions that are 
partially cloud-controlled such as Hawaii and Socotra). In addition to providing a better understanding of the climatic controls 
on vegetation (and the associated fauna) at high spatial resolution, these cloudiness products may be useful for conservation 
and restoration efforts in cloud-controlled regions where the original vegetation cover has been altered.},

  abstract = {Abstract
Identifying cloud interference in satellite-derived data is a critical step toward developing useful remotely sensed products. Most MODIS land products use a combination of the MODIS (MOD35) cloud mask and the `internal' cloud mask of the surface reflectance product (MOD09) to mask clouds, but there has been little discussion of how these masks differ globally. We calculated global mean cloud frequency for both products, for 2009, and found that inflated proportions of observations were flagged as cloudy in the Collection 5 MOD35 product. These erroneously categorized areas were spatially and environmentally non-random and usually occurred over high-albedo land cover types (such as grassland and savanna) in several regions around the world. Additionally, we found that spatial variability in the processing path applied in the Collection 5 MOD35 algorithm affects the likelihood of a cloudy observation by up to 20\% in some areas. These factors result in abrupt transitions in recorded cloud frequency across land cover and processing-path boundaries impeding their use for fine-scale spatially contiguous modeling applications. We show that together, these artifacts have resulted in significantly decreased and spatially biased data availability for Collection 5 MOD35-derived composite MODIS land products such as land surface temperature (MOD11) and net primary productivity (MOD17). Finally, we compare our results to mean cloud frequency in the new Collection 6 MOD35 product, and find that land cover artifacts have been reduced but not eliminated. Collection 6 thus increases data availability for some regions and land cover types in MOD35-derived products but practitioners need to consider how the remaining artifacts might affect their analysis.},

  abstract = {Although modern ocean color sensors, such as MODIS and SeaWiFS, are often considered global missions, in reality it takes many days, even months, to sample the ocean surface enough to provide complete global coverage. The irregular temporal sampling of ocean color sensors can produce biases in monthly and annual mean chlorophyll estimates. We quantified the biases due to sampling using data assimilation to create a ``truth field'', which we then sub-sampled using the observational patterns of MODIS and SeaWiFS. Monthly and annual mean chlorophyll estimates from these sub-sampled, incomplete daily fields were constructed and compared to monthly and annual means from the complete daily fields of the assimilation model, at a spatial resolution of 1.25{\textdegree} longitude by 0.67{\textdegree} latitude.
The results showed that global annual mean biases were positive, reaching nearly 8\% (MODIS) and \ensuremath{>} 5\% (SeaWiFS). For perspective the maximum interannual variability in the SeaWiFS chlorophyll record was about 3\%. Annual mean sampling biases were low (\ensuremath{<} 3\%) in the mid-latitudes (between - 40{\textdegree} and 40{\textdegree}). Low interannual variability in the global annual mean sampling biases suggested that global scale trend analyses were valid.
High latitude biases were much higher than the global annual means, up to 20\% as a basin annual mean, and over 80\% in some months. This was the result of the high solar zenith angle exclusion in the processing algorithms. Only data where the solar angle is \ensuremath{<} 75{\textdegree} are permitted, in contrast to the assimilation which samples regularly over the entire area and month. High solar zenith angles do not facilitate phytoplankton photosynthesis and low chlorophyll concentrations occurring here are missed by the data sets. Ocean color sensors selectively sample in locations and times of favorable phytoplankton growth, producing overestimates of chlorophyll.
The biases derived from lack of sampling in the high latitudes varied monthly, leading to artifacts in the apparent seasonal cycle from ocean color sensors. A false secondary peak in chlorophyll occurred in May{\textendash}August, which resulted from lack of sampling in the Antarctic.
Persistent clouds, characteristic in the North Pacific, also produced overestimates, again by selectively sampling only the high growth periods. In contrast, areas characterized by thick aerosols showed chlorophyll underestimates to nearly - 30\% in basin monthly means. This was the result of selective sampling in lower aerosol thickness periods, which corresponded with lower phytoplankton growth periods.
A combination of MODIS and SeaWiFS sampling was most effective at reducing mid-latitude biases due to inter-orbit gaps, sun glint, and sensor tilt changes. But these biases were low using a single sensor, suggesting multiple sensors had little effect in reducing global and regional monthly and annual mean biases.
Ocean color data are an invaluable source of information about global biological processes. However, these results suggest that sampling errors need to be considered in applications involving global and regional mean chlorophyll biomasses as well as seasonal variability and regional trend analysis.},

  abstract = {An alternative to the traditional fitting of analytical correlogram models or of a linear model of coregionalization has been recently proposed, whereby the conditions for permissibility of a set of (cross) correlogram tables are imposed on their Fourier transforms, that is on the corresponding set of (cross) spectrum tables. The resulting model is entirely non-parametric and consists of a set of permissible (cross) correlogram tables from which gridded correlogram values can be read directly. This paper gives the suite of GSLIB-type programs to implement this correlogram modeling approach. Presentation of the program is backed by a case study using actual petroleum reservoir data (porosity and seismic reflection energy).},

@article{Foster2012,
  abstract = {AbstractSatellite drift is a historical issue affecting the consistency of those few satellite records capable of being used for studies on climate time scales. Here, the authors address this issue for the Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended (PATMOS-x)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) cloudiness record, which spans three decades and 11 disparate sensors. A two-harmonic sinusoidal function is fit to a mean diurnal cycle of cloudiness derived over the course of the entire AVHRR record. The authors validate this function against measurements from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sensors, finding good agreement, and then test the stability of the diurnal cycle over the course of the AVHRR record. It is found that the diurnal cycle is subject to some interannual variability over land but that the differences are somewhat offset when averaged over an entire day. The fit function is used to generate daily averaged time series of ice, water, and total cloudiness over the tropics, where it is found that the diurnal correction affects the magnitude and even the sign of long-term cloudiness trends. A statistical method is applied to determine the minimum length of time required to detect significant trends, and the authors find that only recently have they begun generating satellite records of sufficient length to detect trends in cloudiness.},
