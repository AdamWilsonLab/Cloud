* AUC model comparison
* add spatial autocorrelation of p(presence)
* reliability of coefficients
* spatial consequences (semi-variogram)
    *   predicted surfaces
    *   point data  

better foundation (baseline relationships ) for modeling
working with data with enflamed spatial autocorrelation could get baseline wrong which is used for prediction
