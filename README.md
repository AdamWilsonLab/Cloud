High-resolution Cloud Climatology for Global Land Areas
=====

## Adam M. Wilson and Walter Jetz

Code associated with the generation of  a Global Cloud Climatology derived from MODIS MOD09 cloud flags.



# Remaining Issues

* Missing data in inter/intra variability
* Albedo issues (Australia)
   *  beaches (high albedo sites with shallow water)
* Albedo  over high elevation areas
* Fine grain cloud variation 
* Validation: find region with high station density to do fine-grain validation example. 
* Timeseries
* Detailed images of interesting regions
* Comparison to coarser products in appendix

four stories
 * Amazing detail of cloud cover
    * confirms detail in some regions with real differences
 * Getting it wrong in landscape  (interpolated precipitation layers)
    *   biodiversity research
 * global picture
    * inter vs. intra annual variability
    * hotspots of cloud extremes
    *
